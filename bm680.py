"""
This file contains the code for extracting data from the bm680 sensor. The file should be run from the
raspberry pi that is connected to the sensor.

The file can be run in two different modes:
readable: Outputting the data with supportive notation that helps in understanding the output.
pure: Outputting only the pure data as to minimize the size of the output.

The file outputs temperature (C), air pressure (hPa), humidity (%RH), gas resistance (Ohms) and air quality (%).
